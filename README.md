# LED-Cube-Code-Generator-3D
This is an application for generating code for a LED cube. The application is capable of simulating the LED cube as well as generate the necessary code for programming the LED cube in either Arduino or Embedded C for Atmel chips. This works for a 4x4x4 LED cube and will eventually include a 8x8x8.
